          For this second design intervention we were contacted by Jessica Fern√°ndez, the director of engineering for industrial design at Elisava, to provide our Mycelium workshop to their 3rd year engineering students. We promptly accepted as this represented a huge opportunity not only to share our knowledge with university students that were eager to learn but also to have a peek into the research academic world at Elisava.
          <br>
          <br>As soon as we accepted we were hit with a number of challenges that we were going to have to deal with very quickly. The workshop we were to give to the students was a 2 day workshop of 6 hours in total, much longer than the 1st version of our workshop. Additionally, we also had but a few days before the first day of the workshop. This meant that we didn't have time to grow new substrates, material examples or prepare lab equipment and instead had to rely on what we already had in our surroundings.
          <br>Since this class was directed at university students that already had some knowledge of the topic and had to present a project using mycelium as a material, we had to go much more in depth than in our previous workshop and had to also be much better studied in the practicalities of using and growing mycelium as a material. This meant that both Julia and I had to study a lot more in order to be able to answer all of the questions and enquiries that the students would have for us.

          We have the objective of creating a network of people interested in the field of mycology and switch the conversation from sustainable design to regenerative design. We decided that our workshop was to be a storyline of how fungi could bioremediate various contaminants such as plastics or crude oil, which could then grow into something that could be used for fabrication (molding mycelium into various shapes with a myriad of uses). The message that we're trying to communicate is how mycelium has the power to de-fabricate and then fabricate again, returning waste that was interrupting the life cycle of the planet back into organic materials that are then benefiting the earth.
          <br>We want the workshop to be theoretical and practical. We want to know how much people currently know about mycelium, and expand through storytelling their knowledge of the topic. The participants would then involve themselves and their hands into matching fungi strains with the waste thay they could degrade. Afterwards, they would carry out the procedure of making a mycelium brick, from the substrate inoculation to the filling of the mold.

            <p style = "margin-right: 10px" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
          The first part of our workshop consisted of a general overview of the fungi kingdom: on what constituted a fungi, its legacy and its impact on planetary history, how it connects the forest, how it is the digestive system of the natural world, how it is edible and highly nutritious, can be used as biofuel, and its bioremediation & fabrication properties. We briefly went through a vocabulary of mycological terms such as spores, fruiting bodies, substrates, and inoculation.
          <br> Afterwards we dove into Bioremediation, or in this case Mycoremediation. The participants learned how bioremediation works and the current knowledge of its extent. Some of the toxic materials that we touched that could be degraded and turned into organic matter by mycelium include:
          <ul>
            <li>Contaminated soil</li>
            <li>Oil spills</li>
            <li>Cigarette buts</li>
            <li>Wastewater</li>
            <li>Polyurethane</li>
            <li>Polyethylene</li>
            <li>Oxo-biodegradable plastic</li>
            <li>Polypropylene</li></ul>

            We demonstrated the experiment we're currently carrying out, which consists of a Pleurotus Ostreatus fungi degrading an oxo-biodegradable plastic bag we got from a convenience store. By showing this experiment, we also showed them the proper procedure in order to carry out an experiment and the materials required.

            <p style = "margin-right: 10px" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
          The second part of our workshop featured the fabrication aspects of mycelium. We talked about the incredible way in which mycelium acts as a glue for agricultural waste, and this then creates a solid structure with several propertier such as
          <ol>
            <li>Hydrophobic</li>
            <li>Non-flammable</li>
            <li>Grows into any desired form</li>
            <li>Strong and thus safe for earthquake zones </li>
            <li>Insulative</li>
            <li>Absorbs sounds</li>
            <li>Structural</li></ol>

            We reviewed some of its more practical applications, such as its use as acoustic panels, insulation, and even leather and textiles. We tried to make this section as familiar as possible, with the objective of inspiring the participants into trying it by themselves for their own projects. We went through a very easy to understand step-by-step process on how to obtain a mycelium, how to handle it, how to compress it into whichever shape you like, cultivating it and drying it. We discussed growing ideas for practical uses, different growing methods, and the possible applications and implications of a world where mycelium materials are more widely adopted.

          Organising and carrying out this workshop alongside my partner Julia was a great experience. From beginning to end, we organised ourselves based on our skills, strengths and interests in order to seamlessly build up an intervention that taught both of us a great deal about good teamwork. While carrying out the research for this project, I could clean up many of the facts and processes that I was working with. When having to explain a complicated topic to other people (such as the bioremediation process of polymer degradation by fungal organisms) one is forced to simplify the terms and explanations, making it then more clear to the person giving the explanation.
          <br>
          <br>
          We encountered a group of people with varying levels of interest in the fungal kingdom, and it helped us explore the general impressions that people had of fungi and mycelium. The workshop had tremendous success and we were left with several requests for a second part of the workshop where we would dive even deeper into a specific part of the workshop. This experiment served as a rapid prototyping exercise towards constructing and showcasing an area of deep interest. We were able to see what's important and what isn't, what works and what doesn't, and what is of interest to someone that is just getting started with mycelium vs someone who is already quite experienced.
