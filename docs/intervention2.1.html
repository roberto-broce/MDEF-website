We discussed the broader aspects of the fungal kingdom, their applications, implications, and future possibilities.<br><br>2. We talked about fungi’s ability to bio-remediate and did an activity with fungi cards. The students had to read a bit about each myco-remediating fungi species and guess which toxins they are able to decompose.&nbsp;<br><br>3. We presented a number of different growing/fabrication techniques and examples of projects done by professionals, students, and myco-enthusiasts.&nbsp;<br><br>4. We tasked the students to split up in groups and think of a design and think about what technique they would use to implement the design. As a class, we discussed how the students could implement it as a material for their designs.<br>‍<br><span class="dark-teal-heading-4">Day 2</span> <br><br>1. Students brought in their own molds and we did a demonstration on how to fill their molds with a substrate (Pleurotus Ostreatus grain spawn). We emphasized the importance of sterilizing the tools and workspace. We included practical details and tips that the students could then carry on to their own projects.<br><br>2. We demonstrated how to inoculate a petri dish filled with an agar-starch-dextrose medium with Pleurotus Ostreatus. We explained that we had done this experiment in order to see if the mycelium would decompose pieces of LDPE or OXO biodegradable plastics. This experiment also shows that mycelium can grow on different substrates and can be done without the plastic toxin added.&nbsp;<br><br>3. We collected some of the students emails and introduced them to the notion board that we created to share knowledge on the topic of fungi fabrication.<br><br><span class="dark-teal-heading-4">Elisava's communications team published a video of the second day of the workshop on Instagram</span><br><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CZrSom1qkEQ/?utm_medium=copy_link"><span class="label-green">https://www.instagram.com/reel/CZrSom1qkEQ/?utm_medium=copy_link</span></a><br></p></div></div><img src="./intervention2.1_files/62012136d6476558c895e7b7_myco-remediation-experiments.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 3456px) 100vw, 3456px" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62012136d6476558c895e7b7_myco-remediation-experiments-p-800.jpeg 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62012136d6476558c895e7b7_myco-remediation-experiments-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62012136d6476558c895e7b7_myco-remediation-experiments-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62012136d6476558c895e7b7_myco-remediation-experiments.jpg 3456w" alt="" class="image-with-padding"><div class="columns-for-2-images w-row"><div class="column-3 w-col w-col-6"><img src="./intervention2.1_files/62026b9b15d70988c59089e3_mycelium-class-presentation-1.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62026b9b15d70988c59089e3_mycelium-class-presentation-1-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62026b9b15d70988c59089e3_mycelium-class-presentation-1-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62026b9b15d70988c59089e3_mycelium-class-presentation-1.jpg 2987w" alt="" class="image-5"></div><div class="column-4 w-col w-col-6"><img src="./intervention2.1_files/62026b9c5328b6bb0b39eb30_mycelium-class-presentation-2.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 99vw, (max-width: 991px) 49vw, (max-width: 5164px) 50vw, 2582px" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62026b9c5328b6bb0b39eb30_mycelium-class-presentation-2-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62026b9c5328b6bb0b39eb30_mycelium-class-presentation-2.jpg 2582w" alt=""></div></div><div class="wf-section"><div class="container-2 w-container"><h1 class="heading-3">The participants</h1><p><span class="dark-teal-heading-4">Who were the students?</span><br><br>3rd year Engineering of Industrial Design students who had signed up for this elective course on Mycelium.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="dark-teal-heading-4">The class brief</span><br><br>This year we will experiment with Mycelium simultaneously with a conceptual as well as a hands on approach. The course is structured in two main blocks. During the 4 first weeks of the course the student is encouraged to experiment and to release quick projects without much thought or research; to experiment directly with materials or to quickly mock up rough ideas. Besides the experimental work, the students are conceptually guided by some talks and workshops through a diverse range of social, economic and cultural aspects of the material and the context.&nbsp; In the second bloc, from week 4 to 10, the students should define areas of interest and develop a product from brief to development, prototyping, art direction and communication.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="dark-teal-heading-4">What were the students interested in learning?</span><br><br>The students were very interested in understanding how to fabricate products with mycelium. During the course they would be tasked to create a final product using mycelium. The students were keen to learn about how to combine mycelium with other materials such as textiles and bio-plastics. Some students seemed interested in learning about fungi’s bio-remediating capabilities but were not focused on this area.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="dark-teal-heading-4">What were the students interested in learning?<br></span><br>How can we create flexibility?<br>How can we alter the color or dye mycelium?<br>How can we achieve a thin layer of mycelium?&nbsp;<br>How can we grow mycelium on textiles or mix it with fabrics?<br>How can we make the mycelium dense and strong?<br>How can we mix mycelium with bioplastics?<br>How can we grow pure mycelium or create mycelium “leather”?<br></p></div></div><div class="columns-for-2-images w-row"><div class="column-3 w-col w-col-6"><img src="./intervention2.1_files/62026b9f03c216545d98151a_mycelium-class-3.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-5"></div><div class="column-4 w-col w-col-6"><img src="./intervention2.1_files/62026b9d9d5670008d69acfd_mycelium-class-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></div></div><div class="wf-section"><div class="container-2 w-container"><h1 class="heading-3">Some challenges</h1><p>We didn’t have time for sufficient preparation and prior communication. When we were offered this opportunity we did not know exactly what expectations the professor had and because it was organized last minute, we only had time to meet with the professor an hour before the class to go over the details.&nbsp; We did not know what mycelium materials she had and we did not have time to order more or different material. The purchased substrate had been out of the fridge for 7 days before we were able to do the demonstration and work with it. This is not ideal because the mycelium was already growing at room temperature for a week and would not grow as well going forward.<br><br>We didn’t know much about the students and what they had done in the previous sessions of this course. We found out while speaking with them that they had already received a class on some general information on mycelium and therefore the first part of our class may have been repetitive.&nbsp;<br><br>Getting all the materials organized in a very short amount of time was a chaotic. We had to run to buy potatoes and tape at the last minute. Somebody from Elisava had to run and buy Petri dishes for the experiment. We had to change the order of the class on the fly because we didn’t have the right materials.&nbsp;<br><br>We have never worked that specific substrate (grain spawn) and we did not know what the result would be. We worked with the substrate in the same way we had worked&nbsp;with the inoculated sawdust substrate from Mycelium Materials Europe.&nbsp;<br><br>To sterilize a classroom and tools for 20 different people is very difficult to do.&nbsp;<br><br>The students were going to repeat these experiments and so they had lots of specific questions. We didn’t know the answers to everything but we could give educated responses and recommendations.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div><div class="wf-section"><img src="./intervention2.1_files/62011f49d63a43a8c283f2c1_agar-starch-dextrose-demo.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 3226px) 100vw, 3226px" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011f49d63a43a8c283f2c1_agar-starch-dextrose-demo-p-500.jpeg 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011f49d63a43a8c283f2c1_agar-starch-dextrose-demo-p-800.jpeg 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011f49d63a43a8c283f2c1_agar-starch-dextrose-demo-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011f49d63a43a8c283f2c1_agar-starch-dextrose-demo-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011f49d63a43a8c283f2c1_agar-starch-dextrose-demo.jpg 3226w" alt="" class="image-with-padding"></div><div class="columns-for-2-images w-row"><div class="column-3 w-col w-col-6"><img src="./intervention2.1_files/62011efd7dc75872c9423e3e_agar-dextrose-starch-medium.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011efd7dc75872c9423e3e_agar-dextrose-starch-medium-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011efd7dc75872c9423e3e_agar-dextrose-starch-medium-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011efd7dc75872c9423e3e_agar-dextrose-starch-medium-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61a903c45ceded125578bcf1/62011efd7dc75872c9423e3e_agar-dextrose-starch-medium.jpg 2943w" alt="" class="image-5"></div><div class="column-4 w-col w-col-6"><img src="./intervention2.1_files/62011eeae50907b9e81fc508_bunsen-burner-demo-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></div></div><div class="wf-section"><div class="container-2 w-container"><h1 class="heading-3">Successful moments</h1><p>Because we didn’t not have a lot of time to prepare and we were missing materials we had to think on the fly and come up and were able to adapt the class to the circumstances.<br><br>We had done a lot of research before hand and were ready to give recommendations, educated guesses, and related resources.

She said that she would be happy to invite to the Hangar to meet some of her colleagues.&nbsp;<br><br>Jessica, the professor of the mycelium course is the director of Elisava’s Research department and we hope we can stay in contact with her and could potentially repeat such a workshop for other students at Elisava.<br><br>During the course on mycelium, other designers and scientists will be presenting about mycelium. I would like to message Jessica to learn about who these guests are and if there is a possibility to meet them.&nbsp;<br></p></div><div class="container-2 w-container"><h1 class="heading-3">What are our next steps?</h1><p>I would like to get my hands dirty and start experimenting with different mycelium strains and substrates.<br><br>We are hoping to help get the IAAC Biolab up and running soon in order to start doing experiments with different strains of mycelium in petri dishes. We want to do some bio-remediate experiments to identify which strains eat plastic the best. We also want to identify what strains are best for fabrication.&nbsp;<br><br>We want to assemble our own substrates and inoculate them. I would like to see if I can use agricultural waste, toxic soils, or bits of plastic the substrate. <br><br>I want to try to use recycled textiles as material for molds or to incorporate them in the design. I am interested in designing mycelium products for product design and architectural applications.<br><br>Inspired by the Remix the Barrio initiative, we are interested in collecting sawdust and coffee grinds from local businesses in Poblenou to add to the substrate that we want to grow on.<br><br>I also want to maintain the notion board and I hope that we can find other myco-enthusiasts who are willing to participate and share knowledge. I am interested to see how this platform will evolve and if people find it useful or not amidst the plethora of other mycology sites and forums on the web.&nbsp;<br><br>I have contacted Jessica Dias, who works with Lara Campos. Jessica has been working with mycelium for some time now and we hope that the can learn more about her practice and get inspired by her DIY lab.&nbsp;<br></p></div><div class="container-2 w-container"></div></div><footer id="footer" class="footer-red wf-section"><div class="w-container"><div class="footer-flex-container"><div><h2 class="footer-heading-light">Masters in Design for Emergent Futures</h2><ul role="list" class="w-list-unstyled"><li><a href="https://julia-steketee.webflow.io/design-studio/an-in-depth-mycelium-workshop-at-elisava#" class="footer-link-light">Instituto de Arquitectura Avançada de Catalonia</a></li><li><a href="https://julia-steketee.webflow.io/design-studio/an-in-depth-mycelium-workshop-at-elisava#" class="footer-link-light">Elisava, Escola Superior de Disseny i Enginyeria</a></li><li><a href="https://julia-steketee.webflow.io/design-studio/an-in-depth-mycelium-workshop-at-elisava#" class="footer-link-light">FabLab BCN</a><h2 class="footer-heading-light">julia.steketee@students.iaac.net</h2><h2 class="footer-heading-light-copy"><a href="https://www.juliasteketee.com/" class="footer-heading-light">juliasteketee.com</a></h2></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer-heading-light">Copyright © 2021 Julia Steketee.

The course is structured in two main blocks. During the 4 first weeks of the course the student is encouraged to experiment and to release quick projects without much thought or research; to experiment directly with materials or to quickly mock up rough ideas. Besides the experimental work, the students are conceptually guided by some talks and workshops through a diverse range of social, economic and cultural aspects of the material and the context.&nbsp; In the second bloc, from week 4 to 10, the students should define areas of interest and develop a product from brief to development, prototyping, art direction and communication.&nbsp;<br><br><span class="dark-teal-heading-4">What were the students interested in learning?</span><br><br>The students were very interested in understanding how to fabricate products with mycelium. During the course they would be tasked to create a final product using mycelium. The students were keen to learn about how to combine mycelium with other materials such as textiles and bio-plastics. Some students seemed interested in learning about fungi’s bio-remediating capabilities but were not focused on this area.&nbsp;<br></p><div class="columns w-row"><div class="w-col w-col-8"><p class="paragraph-5"><span class="dark-teal-heading-4">Which species of fungi can myco-remediate?</span><br><br>Roberto and I dove into scientific articles and found a variety of species that have been found to decompose different toxic materials. After spending a good amount of time researching, I came to the conclusion that surely there are many more species that have this remarkable ability but we simply have not done sufficient research. We found around 20 different species that can bio-remediate different types of toxins. Many researchers are now trying to figure out how to design the ideal environment for the fungi to speed up this process to deal with the scale of our plastic, pesticide, and pollution problems. &nbsp;I assembled a card deck of all of the toxin eating fungi species and during the workshop we set up an activity. On the table lay samples of different types of toxins. We passed out the cards and the participants were tasked to read the bit of information on the card and try to guess which of the toxic samples the fungi species can digest. This deck is downloadable by scanning the QR code to the right. Below, you can see each toxic substrate and their corresponding myco-remediators.</p></div><div class="w-col w-col-4"><img src="./intervention2.1_files/61b911de1828f16bacf90943_myco-cards-qr.svg" loading="lazy" height="500" alt=""></div></div></div><script src="./intervention2.1_files/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js.descarga" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="./intervention2.1_files/webflow.2a0fff34d.js.descarga" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]-->
