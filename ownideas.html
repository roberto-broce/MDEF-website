          We were to sketch a short self-portrait on a small sheet of paper for the first exercise of this course. We then made "Magic Machines" out of material waste for that version of ourselves after it was finished. I sat with the post-consumer group, and we brought together our creations after having made the prototypes individually. Cardboard, 3D printer debris, fablab scraps, and trash discovered around IAAC served as our materials.

        Despite the fact that we individually developed unique artifacts, we as a group have discovered common meanings for our magical machines. Human connections could be summarized as a machine that aids communication between two individuals, detects emotions through empathy, finds new ways of catching potential friends, finds your loved ones, or frames a moment. We all worked together to come up with a way to make something that interacts with one another emotionally, cognitively, and physically.</p>

          My machine consisted of a simple device that would benefit those looking for loved ones after a natural disaster such as an earthquake. The device would shoot a little laser that would indicate the user if a thermal signal from a human being was detected. This device could also help people in all sorts of situations find their loved ones, be it at a disaster setting or out camping. What I learned from this exercise was the magic of simplicity, sometimes a device that is easy to hold, easy to understand, and easy to use can have a bigger impact than an overly complex machine that few are able to use.</p>

          Our mission was to complete a 24-hour rigorous exercise in which we would immerse ourselves in a certain topic of interest. We would be able to experience our ideas by incorporating them into every aspect of our existence during that day. We can develop new ideas and fascinating outcomes by shifting our thoughts from scheduled routines into everyday chaos.

          My first person exploration revolved around the topic of <i>recycling</i>. I am constantly thinking about my own waste, the waste from others, the global waste management system and how it is so fundamentally broken. Back in Panama where I'm from, recycling is very limited and inefficient. We often look to Europe as an example of how recycling should be, but as I arrived here and analysed my surroundings I grew wary of the image I had previously created in my head of how recycling in Spain would be. In order to further my exploration of recycling to a first person perspective, I decided to chase trash around my neighborhood and see whether its contents were being sorted properly or not. I also extrapolated recycling data from official sources of the internet to the recycling bins, because even though an item might be recyclable and is properly sorted in the correct bin, it may not be recycled due to recycling capabilities of the centres, cost of recycling, contamination or a range of other reasons.</p>

          During this experiment I went into the slightly uncomfortable task of diving into dumpsters all around my neighborhood for a day. Doing this exercise proved two things to me: how detached people are to the concept of waste, and how trusting people are in the recycling system and how this makes the problem even worse.
          <br>
        The first point has to do with the "looks" I would get from people and the questions I would get from friends. My friends would query things like "why are you touching trash?" and "why are you sticking your hand into the bin?", meanwhile I would get strange looks by bypassers whenever I would dive into a yellow bin. At first I was a little embarrassed about it and would just say something like "oh it's for class" but then I thought a little deeper about the undertone of those questions. Why were they so weirded out by trash? Even if it's our own trash?
        <br>There is a fundamental disconnect between us and our waste. Thanks to our modern waste management system, we can afford to place our waste in little magic boxes where they magically disappear into Neverland and we can stop thinking about it. Daring to ponder about it or even worse <i>touching</i> said waste is gross and unthinkable. Our waste is as much ours as the product was before we consumed it. The only way to deal with our byproducts in an effective manner is to close the gap between users and their consumed product. Nature itself has no waste, as everything is reused in a closed loop system. Similarly, we should strive to rid ourselves of the concept of waste and bring us closer to our consumed products.
        <br>
        <br>
      Secondly, the people I interacted with throughout the length of this experiment proved to me that there was indeed very high confidence in the recycling system. This is influenced by deceptive industry practices such as the "green dot" that many packages have, which communicate the erroneous idea that the item is recyclable when in fact it is nothing more than a mandatory seal that all products in Spain must get before being able to circulate the market. It basically just means that the company has paid the fee. Additionally, many of the items marked as 'recycled' are in fact sent abroad where they are not recycled at all and instead just pushed into landfills or incinerators. The result is a population that is highly trusting of its recycling system, that in part also caused the Spanish population to consume significantly more plastic than countries like Indonesia or Colombia that don't have such a 'robust' recycling system. It's a broken system that ends up contaminating much more than it is thought to be.</p>
